1.01 2000.10.02 Initial public release

Provides an adapter layer between core routines for converting
to and from UTF8 and other encodings. In essence, a way to give 
multiple existing Unicode modules a single common interface so 
you don't have to know the underlaying implementations to do 
simple UTF8 to-from other character set string conversions. 
As such, it wraps the Unicode::String, Unicode::Map8,
Unicode::Map and Jcode modules in a standardized and simple 
API.
