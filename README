Unicode::MapUTF8 - Conversions to and from arbitrary character sets and UTF8

1.02 2000.10.22 Bug fix to 'from_utf8' method and load time
                detection of Unicode::Map8 supported character
                set encodings

1.01 2000.10.02 Initial public release

Provides an adapter layer between core routines for converting
to and from UTF8 and other encodings. In essence, a way to give 
multiple existing Unicode modules a single common interface so 
you don't have to know the underlaying implementations to do 
simple UTF8 to-from other character set string conversions. 
As such, it wraps the Unicode::String, Unicode::Map8,
Unicode::Map and Jcode modules in a standardized and simple 
API.
